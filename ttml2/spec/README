To build TTML2 spec, make sure ant is installed.

Make sure the following are included in your .hgrc as well as whatever else you need to make hg go, like your username in [ui], w3c authentication in [auth], proxy in [http_proxy] if you need it, etc:

--
[extensions]
keyword =

[keyword]
ttml2/spec/ttml2.xml =

[keywordmaps]
Author = {author|user}
Date = {date|utcdate}
Header = {root}/{file},v {node|short} {date|utcdate} {author|user}
Id = {file|basename},v {node|short} {date|utcdate} {author|user}
RCSFile = {file|basename},v
RCSfile = {file|basename},v
Revision = {node|short}
Source = {root}/{file},v
--

To edit and build, if you're the Editor:

1. hg pull -u
2. edit ttml2.xml
3. ant sg
4. if more edits, goto 2
5. hg revert -C ttml2.html
6. hg commit -m ...
7. ant rgc
8. hg push

Line 5 reverts the html, line 6 commits just the changes you made to the source xml, line 7 regenerates the ED and commits it with a standard message, and line 8 pushes the changes including the html back to the repository.

If you're Not the Editor but want to push a change, omit steps 7 and 8 and replace with:

9. Email the Editor notifying of the changes so that the Editor can review and rebuild the ED.
