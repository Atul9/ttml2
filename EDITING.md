# TTML2 EDITING GUIDELINES

The following guidelines apply to the various processes used in the development and maintenance of the TTML2 specification.

## Pull-Requests

A pull-request (PR) should be created for every non-trivial change to the specification; furthermore, each pull request should be associated with an issue.

When creating a remote branch that is intended to lead to a PR, that branch should be named ``issue-0000(-token)+`` where the issue number is zero filled into ``0000``. For example:

<pre>
issue-0158-use-of-60-seconds-in-clock-expression
issue-0156-create-customizations-section
</pre>

## Nominal Pull-Request Review Period

A nominal 14 day review period applies to a PR starting on the date the PR was created. Notwithstanding this nominal review period, and at the editor's discretion, a merge of the PR may occur prior to the end of this period.

## Pull-Request Merging

The editor may merge a PR, with or without changes, at any time, with or without notice. The editor may delegate the merging of a PR to the creator of the PR or to another party. If merging a PR has been delegated, then the editor and delegatee should coordinate mergers to avoid unintended conflicts.

If a PR merge is effected prior to the end of the nominal review period, then a ``Merge Early`` label must be applied to the associated issue; otherwise, a ``Merge Standard`` label may be applied, or, if not present, assumed to apply if the nominal review period has elapsed.

A PR merged before the period has elapsed that has no ``Merge Early`` label should be considered an error state, and such label should be added.

PR merges occur only from a PR branch to the gh-pages (default) branch.

## Post Pull-Request Merge Issues

Since the PR merge process described above is based on a Commit-Then-Review (CTR) process, it is possible that issues may arise that require resolution post-merge, e.g.,

* technical problem with post-merge specification content
* editorial problem with post-merge specification content
* principled objection to merge

If such an issue should arise, then a new issue should be created, which should @mention the original issue in its title and/or descriptive text.

If an issue documenting an objection is entered against an issue marked as ``Merge Early``, then a ``Merge Objection`` label should be applied to the latter issue, i.e., the issue on which an early PR merge occurred. In addition, a comment must be added to the latter issue that @mentions the issue describing the objection.

## Non-Pull-Request Commits

Only the editor or a delegated team member may perform a non-PR based commit. These should generally be limited to trivial changes or changes that do not affect specificiation content. If performed by a delegated team member, that member should coordinate with the editor to avoid unintended conflicts.

## Lazy Consensus Applies

This project operates on the principles of lazy consensus, a reasonable description of which can be found at
[Apache Raveâ„¢ Project](https://rave.apache.org/docs/governance/lazyConsensus.html).
